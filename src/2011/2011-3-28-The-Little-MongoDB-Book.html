<p>The book is available as a <a href="https://www.openmymind.net/mongodb.pdf">pdb</a> and <a href="https://www.openmymind.net/mongodb.epub">epub</a></p>

<p>A couple weeks ago I released <a href="http://www.openmymind.net/mongly/">mongly</a>. The feedback has been great, but I've noticed that a lot of people still have some fundamental questions about MongoDB. Questions like, where does it fit and how do you model your data? I initially thought about writing a couple blog posts, but I felt that a short ebook might be a better format.</p>

<p>I hope you like it and that it proves useful. You can download the <a href="https://www.openmymind.net/mongodb.pdf">PDF version here</a>. It comes it at a respectable 32 pages. I tried to cover a number of topics with a focus on the fundamentals you'll need to get comfortably up and running.</p>

<p>I wrote it in markdown, the source is <a href="http://github.com/karlseguin/the-little-mongodb-book">available on github</a>. PanDoc was used to convert the book. The process was painless after a couple attempts. I'm also quite happy with the output (especially in comparison to how much work went into perfectly formatting Foundations of Programming using Word)</p>

<p>For the curious, the idea to write this hit me while I was going to sleep last Saturday. A little over half the book was written on Sunday, in around 4-5 hours. The MapReduce chapter was taken from a blog post I had already written (with necessary tweaks). <a href="http://twitter.com/perryneal">Perry Neal</a> provided some really quick turn arouns for initial edits/feedback. Of course, given the speed at which this was done, corrections and feedback are welcomed in any format (email, comment, pull requests).</p>
